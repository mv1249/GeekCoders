A Simple Blogging Website made using Django Framework
for Frontend i've used Bootstrap Framework,and for the database i've used the database provided by django,which is dbsqlite3,i've used dynamic paging here,i.e i'll write all my blogposts in the database,and as soon as i commit my post,that post will be rendered to the main webpage,and the user will be able to find a new post,so here django acts like a backend which connects the frontend and the Database,the blogsite is hosted on heroku cloud platform,where heroku cloud services will control all the Database servers and stuff,the link of the site is ===> https://geekcoders.herokuapp.com/
